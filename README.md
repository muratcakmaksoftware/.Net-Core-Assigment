# ASP.NET CORE API AND CONSOLE

1- Create two console applications under a solution which accomplish the following:
- Finds multiply of all prime numbers below a given integer limit.
- Finds "PascalCase" words in a given string, then sorts uppercase characters and then numbers if any. Example: "This iS a PascalCase3 eXample." -> "CPT3"
The architectural design is up to you.
 
2- Create the following system in an asynchronous way:
- Write a simple netCore WebAPI which has two controllers. First one generates and returns a random signed 8-bit integer number every 1 second. Second one generates and returns a random Turkish alphabet character every two seconds.
- A consumer frontEnd for the webAPI with your technology of choice which displays those numbers and characters as they are available.
